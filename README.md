## Request Flow for Shortening the URL
![Chat Preview](https://i.imgur.com/5mUbTPr.jpeg)


#### User must be authenticated in order to make `POST, UPDATE, PATCH and DELETE` requests
1. User inserts URL to shorten and makes `POST` request to the server
2. Server checks the inserted URL if it was shortened before (Checks the Database if it already exists)
3. If inserted URL is shortened before (already exists in DB), the short url will returned to the user (client) from Database
4. If it is not in Database, the inserted URL will be passed for Hashing (Encoding)
5. Hashing uses MD5 Hashing Algorithm to hash the inserted URL and returns Hashed value
  <br/> Hashed value will be used for making a short url to navige the user to the original url:
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
Same URLs should yield same Short URL for the SAME user.
But same URLs should yield DIFFERENT Short URLs for DIFFERENT users.
For that case, we use 'Hashing'.
We can hash the URL and then use its first 5 characters of the hashed URL as the pointer to the original URL.

BUT there is a PROBLEM !!!!!
PROBLEM: Hash COLLISION !!!!

Example:
User1 => hash("URL") => "abc"
User2 => hash("SAME URL") => "abc"

This what Hash COLLISION is

But we DON'T want that to happen
SAME URL must generate DIFFERENT URLs for DIFFERENT users

------------------------------
My Solution for Hash COLLISION
------------------------------
SOLUTION: we can insert USER_ID into the URL.

Explore the diagram below to see how URLs are Hashed
```
`URL Hashing` <br />

`Hashing Algorithm:` <br/>

```
- Appends Hash value: 'h7d34' to 'domain name' and saves it in Database
- Short URL:    'kiska.com/h7d34'
- Map the Short URL to Original URL
Whenever user make a request to Short URL, Short URL redirects the user to Original URL
```
